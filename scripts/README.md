## TODO

1. close chrome.
2. update youtubes days views.
3. how do i deal with downloads?
    * as one playlist, this would mean redesigning how the subtitles are
      selected from the directory. There would be two files json, srt.
      sometimes juts one is downloaded but it would not be able to tell which
      and how.
      loop through one at a time. less efficient.
      if they are downloaded as a play list the path finder issue.
